### About Me

I am currently a GIT online major. After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in the graphic design/web development field.

I am a beginner to coding, but I hope to learn more. I have experience with production design and some JavaScript knowledge.

In my free time, I enjoy watching short-form videos and relaxing my mind.
